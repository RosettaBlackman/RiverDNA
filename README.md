Spatio-temporal patterns of multi-trophic biodiversity and food-web characteristics uncovered across a river catchment using environmental DNA  


The information contained in this repository is referenced in the manuscript:
1. Genera level data used for analysis (12S, COI and 16S). This data is taxonomically assigned and has been filtered for those taxa which are either purely aquatic or have an aquatic life stage
2. Genera information per functional feeding group, average and standard deviation for all samples used for analysis in the food web section of the above paper
