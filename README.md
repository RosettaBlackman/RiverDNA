The information contained in this repository is referenced in the above manuscript:
1. Data post taxonomic assignment for the three libraries - 12S, COI and 16S (Bioinformatics details can be found in the above manuscript supp info).
2. Genera information per functional feeding group, average and standard deviation for all samples used for analysis in the food web section of the above paper
3. LocalWebs_generation - Metaweb script
4. Files used for the metaweb script: 
River_DNA = presence/absence of all sites (rows) and genus (column)    
DMat = matrix of all taxa consumers (cols) and resource (rows)
Func = function classifications and refs
Link = rlink consumers (col1) to resource (col2)

Raw sequences for the data generated in this study can be found on the European Nucleotide Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) Project No. PRJEB50676
