# RiverDNA

Spatio-temporal patterns of multi-trophic biodiversity and food-web characteristics uncovered across a river catchment using environmental DNA  


The information contained in this repository is referenced in the manuscript:
1. Data post taxonomic assignment for the three libraries - 12S, COI and 16S.
2. Genera information per functional feeding group, average and standard deviation for all samples used for analysis in the food web section of the above paper
3. LocalWebs_generation - Metaweb script
4. Files used for the metaweb script: 
River_DNA = presence/absence of all sites (rows) and genus (column)    
DMat = matrix of all taxa consumers (cols) and resource (rows)
Func = function classifications and refs
Link = rlink consumers (col1) to resource (col2)
